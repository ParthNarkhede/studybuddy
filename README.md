# Study Buddy: A Collaborative Learning Platform

This project presents "Study Buddy," a platform designed to enhance collaborative learning experiences for students studying advanced data structures. 

## Problem

Students often struggle with complex concepts in data structures. Collaborative learning can significantly improve understanding and retention, but finding compatible study partners can be challenging. 

## Solution

The Study Buddy platform addresses this challenge by providing a personalized matching system, facilitating meaningful connections between students with shared interests, learning styles, and goals. 

## Key Features

* *Dynamic Tree-Based Questionnaire:* Users navigate a personalized questionnaire that adapts to their responses, ensuring accurate matching.
* *Sophisticated Matching Algorithm:* Utilizes heuristics and machine learning to pair users based on their skills, learning preferences, and availability.
* *Intuitive Search Functionality:* Employing trie data structures, users can quickly find study buddies based on specific criteria, like study habits, expertise, or availability.
* *User-Friendly Interface:* Accessible across devices, providing a seamless experience for users.
* *Continuous Improvement:*  Feedback mechanisms allow for ongoing refinements to the matching algorithm, ensuring optimal partner assignments.

## Technology Stack

* *Backend:*
    * User Authentication: Secure protocols like OAuth or JWT.
    * APIs: RESTful APIs for user registration, login, and profile management.
    * Database: MySQL or MongoDB for storing user data and questionnaire responses.
* *Frontend:*
    * HTML, CSS, JavaScript for UI development.
    * Responsive design for compatibility across devices.
